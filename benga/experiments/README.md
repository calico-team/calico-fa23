# Experiments
This folder contains experiments, prototype, and tools used in problem development.

## CDF
This is the final version of the problem that was used: summing up ways for all layers 1..N.

## 3x3xn
The original version of the problem where you just count the number of ways with N layers, not summing up 1..N.

We also considered variations where we required all bricks to be visible from the outside. This condition didn't make the final cut.

## 4x4xn
An experiment with 4x4xn and variations.

## 2x2x2xn
A 4D variant :flushed: xd
